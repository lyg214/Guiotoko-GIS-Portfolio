## Design Decision


## Methodology  
I first went to Homewood Children's Village Homepage and got the screenshots of its logo and about page photo. Then I used the Canva Palette generator to extract colors. I used adobe color to enhance and accentuate the contract between colors generated by the Canva Palette generator. At the end, I chose 5 colors (refer to color palette section).  
Next, I went to Google's Map Styling Wizard, and used the old style wizard to create the custom map. 
I changed colors of following sections as listed: 
1. All  Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier (#84bcb4)
2. All	Labels / text outline	Color: Windsor  (#38247f )
3. Country	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Fog (#d2cfe0)
4. Province	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Fog (# d2cfe0)
5. Land parcel	Labels / Text fill	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
6. Landscape / Human-made	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
7. Landscape / Natural	Geometry	Color: Waikawa Gray (# 5c5c94)
8. Points of interest	Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcb4)
9. Points of interest	Labels / Text fill outline	Color: Maroon (#84bcb4)
10. POI / Park	Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcb4)
11. Road 	Geometry	Color: Glacier (#84bcb4)
12. Road	Labels / Text fill	Color: Fog (# d2cfe0)
13. Road / Highway	Geometry	Color: Chateau Green  (#519a67)
14. Road / Highway	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Chateau Green  (#519a67)
15. Road / Highway	Labels / Text fill	Color: Fog  (#d2cfe0)
16. Road / Highway	Labels / Text Stroke	Color: Windsor (#38247f)
17. Transit	Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (# 84bcbf)
18. Transit	Labels / Text outline	Color: Windsor (# 38247f)
19. Transit / Line	Geometry / Fill	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
20. Transit / Station	Geometry	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
21. Water	Geometry	Color: Windsor (#38247f)
22. Water	Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcbf)

After all these changes were made, I clicked Finish, and made a copy the JSON code.
