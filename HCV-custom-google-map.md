The images for the project was obtained from the organization website: https://hcvpgh.org/about/

## Design Decision
Color Palette's had two main colors, purple and green. Purple had light to dark shades and green had 2 lighter shades. 
Since the organization website used purple as the main color, I decided to use purple for the land and ocean color. I wanted to draw attention to the land, so i chose the medium purple shade, and used darker purple shade for the water. I didn't use lighter shade purple for the land in this section because the light purple was too bright, and made it difficult to pay attention. In addition it conflicted with the street and label colors. For the streets and labels, I mainly used green shades. I used lighter green shade for the streets to make it easier for people to see and not focus on the highways too much. 

## Methodology  
I first went to Homewood Children's Village Homepage and got the screenshots of its logo and about page photo. Then I used the Canva Palette generator to extract colors. I used adobe color to enhance and accentuate the contract between colors generated by the Canva Palette generator. At the end, I chose 5 colors (refer to color palette section).  
Next, I went to Google's Map Styling Wizard, and used the old style wizard to create the custom map. I chose Aubergene as the initial style. 
Then I made adjustments based on the Palette I chose earlier. 

I changed colors of following sections as listed: 
1. All / Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier (#84bcb4)
2. All / Labels / text outline	Color: Windsor  (#38247f )
3. Country / Geometry / Stroke	Color: Fog (#d2cfe0)
4. Province	 / Geometry / Stroke	Color: Fog (# d2cfe0)
5. Land parcel / Labels / Text fill	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
6. Landscape / Human-made	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
7. Landscape / Natural	Geometry	Color: Waikawa Gray (# 5c5c94)
8. Points of interest / Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcb4)
9. Points of interest	/ Labels / Text fill outline	Color: Maroon (#84bcb4)
10. POI / Park	Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcb4)
11. Road 	Geometry	Color: Glacier (#84bcb4)
12. Road	Labels / Text fill	Color: Fog (# d2cfe0)
13. Road / Highway	Geometry	Color: Chateau Green  (#519a67)
14. Road / Highway	Geometry / Stroke	Color: Chateau Green  (#519a67)
15. Road / Highway	Labels / Text fill	Color: Fog  (#d2cfe0)
16. Road / Highway	Labels / Text Stroke	Color: Windsor (#38247f)
17. Transit	/ Labels / Text fill	Color: Glacier  (# 84bcbf)
18. Transit	/ Labels / Text outline	Color: Windsor (# 38247f)
19. Transit Line / 	Geometry / Fill	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
20. Transit Station /	Geometry	Color: Waikawa Gray (#5c5c94)
21. Water	/ Geometry	Color: Windsor (#38247f)
22. Water	/ Text fill	Color: Glacier  (#84bcbf)

After all these changes were made, I clicked Finish, and saved the copy of json code as "hcv_custom_map.json".
