# Guiotoko-GIS-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the advanced GIS course at CMU. 

# About Me
Hi! I am Lisa Guiotoko(she/her/hers). 

I am a second year MS Candidate at the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Public Policy and Management. My concentration is Policy Analysis, which coverd policy analysis tools (ex: Programming R for Analytics, Programming with Python, GIS, Program Evaluation and Policy Analysis in Practice) and management (ex: Management Science I & II, Evidence Based Management, and Project Management).

I am from Irvine, California, a city that is about an hour away from West LA. I studied International studies and Environmental Geography at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduating and during my time at Heinz, I worked as a Japanese teacher and interned at an IT consulting company supported implementing ERP systems. 

Aside from schools and work, I like oil painting and baking (especially tarts and pies!).

# What I hope to Learn
Through this course I hope to gain new skills of how to present data. I would like to get a better understanding not only on how to create maps using different methods, but also on critiquing methods and making suggestions. I am excited to gain all these skills and be able to utilize on the final project. Hopefully for the final project, I can create a geographical analysis on neighborhood change and gentrification that can be easily understood by wider audiences.
