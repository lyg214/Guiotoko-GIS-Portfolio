# About Me
Hi! I am Lisa Guiotoko(she/her/hers). 

I am a second year MS Candidate at the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Public Policy and Management. My coursework has covered policy analysis tools and methods (like Programming R for Analytics, Programming with Python, GIS, Program Evaluation and Policy Analysis in Practice) and management (like Management Science I & II, Evidence Based Management, and Project Management).

I am from Irvine, California, a city that is about an hour away from West LA. I studied International studies and Environmental Geography at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduating and during my time at Heinz, I worked as a Japanese teacher and interned at an IT consulting company supported implementing ERP systems. 

Aside from schools and work, I like oil painting and baking (especially tarts and pies!).
