# Guiotoko-GIS-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the advanced GIS course at CMU. 

# About Me
Hi! I am Lisa Guiotoko(she/her/hers). 

I am a second year MS Candidate at the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Public Policy and Management. My concentration is Policy Analysis, which covers policy analysis tools (ex: Cost Benefit Analysis, Programming R for Analytics, Programming with Python, GIS, Program Evaluation and Policy Analysis in Practice) and management (ex: Management Science, Evidence Based Management, and Project Management).

I am from Irvine, California, a city that is about an hour away from West LA. I studied Asian studies and Environmental Geography at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduating my undergraduate and during my time at Heinz, I worked as a Japanese teacher and interned at an IT consulting company supported implementing ERP systems. 

# Expectations and Final Outcomes
There were multiple expectations and goals set prior to the course. 
- I hoped to gain new skills on how to present and analyze data through maps. 
- I wanted to get a better understanding not only on how to create maps using different methods, but also on how to crique and make suggestions. 
- For the final project: Utilize skills above and create a geographical analysis on neighborhood change and gentrification that can be easily understood by wider audiences. 

With the completion of the course, I was able to attain majority of the goals that I have set. I was able to learn new softwares and methods including notebook, and ArcGIS Insights. I gained knew knowledge on prediction modeling, suitability models and how to program maps in python.
